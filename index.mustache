	<p>My name’s <strong title="/d͡ʒuliən t͡ʃɛɹi/">Julien Cherry</strong>. I study computer science and linguistics at <a href="https://northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> in Boston, Massachusetts, but currently, I’m <a href="https://careers.northeastern.edu/cooperative-education/">co‑oping</a> at <a href="https://www.basistech.com/">Basis Technology</a> in nearby Cambridge. In the past, I’ve also developed software while working at <a href="https://www.proglove.de/">ProGlove</a> in Munich and <a href="https://pivotal.io/">Pivotal Software</a> in New York City.</p>

	<p>On campus, I spend my time as a research assistant for the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/lingandlaw/">Linguistics & Law Lab</a> and as a member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/neunojokes/">No Jokes</a> improv troupe. I also volunteer for <a href="https://www.operationfriendship.org/">Operation Friendship</a>, a youth exchange organization I’ve been with since high school. Other than that, I love stargazing, sending mail, and creating complex travel itineraries that sometimes end painfully.</p></main>
