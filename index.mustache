	<p>Welcome, fellow <i>Homo sapiens</i>!</p>
	<p>My name is <strong title="/d͡ʒuliən t͡ʃɛɹi/">Julien Cherry</strong>. I study computer science and linguistics at <a href="https://northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a> in Boston, Massachusetts. In between my studies, I’ve also spent a total of a year writing software at <a href="https://www.proglove.de/">ProGlove</a> in Munich and <a href="https://pivotal.io/">Pivotal Software</a> in New York City.</p>

	<p>On most days, you’ll find me rushing across campus—aside from coursework, I’m a teaching assistant for <a href="https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs3500/">Object-Oriented Design</a>, a research assistant for two labs on campus (the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/lingandlaw/">Linguistics & Law Lab</a> and the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/berentlab/">Language and Mind Lab</a>), and a member of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/neunojokes/">No Jokes</a> improv troupe.</p>
	<p>I also spend my time volunteering for <a href="http://operationfriendship.us">Operation Friendship of America</a>, a youth exchange organization I’ve been with since high school. Other than that, I love stargazing, sending mail, and creating complex travel itineraries that sometimes end painfully.</p></main>
