	<h1>{{title}}</h1>
	<p>After digging up my mom’s old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FE">Nikon FE</a> camera and receiving my shipment of film stock, I haphazardly loaded a roll of that 800-speed Fujifilm film into the camera and started shooting. (I was going to make a terrible joke about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_processing">developing an interest in 35-mm photography</a>, but I decided against it.)</p>
	<p>I won’t claim that analog photography results in higher quality pictures than digital photography, but I attest that the experience is better. Modern photography is ubiquitous but careless—snapping a pic on an iPhone takes less than a second. Analog photography encourages patience, intention, and economy, virtues that modern technology has abandoned.</p>
	<p>I invite you to take a look at some of my favorite pictures!</p>
