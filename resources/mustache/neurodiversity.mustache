	<p>A little note on myself: I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity">neurodivergent</a>. This means I think and process information differently than most people, which impacts how I communicate with others. You might not immediately notice it when meeting me because Iâ€™ve spent my whole life learning how to communicate with neurotypical people, but it still is a significant part of who I am. So, if you have any questions on how this impacts how I communicate, please ask and Iâ€™ll be happy to explain ðŸ˜Š
